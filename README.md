# SPS-5926-Predict-heart-failure-using-IBM-auto-ai-service
Predict heart failure using IBM auto ai service
Model Creation Steps:
1) Create IBM cloud login account https://cloud.ibm.com/login
2) Create Watson Studio Service: In this activity, I created Watson studio service to create a project.
3 Create Project In Watson Studio : 
  a. Create a project in Watson studio for creating a project you need Cloud object storage service. 
  b. Creating the project link 
4.Add Dataset Add the dataset to the project by clicking on Assets browse the dataset to store in cloud object storage
5.Add Auto AI To Project: In this activity, you need to add Auto AI to the project. 
6.Create Watson Machine Learning Instance For using Auto AI you need to create a Machine learning instance. According to the lite plan of IBM total of 5 models can be built. 
7.Run The Experiment : Select the prediction parameter which is HEARTFAILURE according to the dataset and run the experiment. Once the model is built save the model that got high accuracy score and save the model. 
8.Deploy The Model and RUN on node-RED GUI 
9.Create Node Red Service.
10.integrate Node-red to model

Files uploaded
1) NODE-RED json file added in github
